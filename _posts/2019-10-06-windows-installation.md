Basic instructions for GitHub pages are [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

1. Learn how to use a good text editor. Good choices:
   * [Atom](https://atom.io)
   * [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org)
   * [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) (advanced)
2. Download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
3. Download and run the latest Ruby+Devkit from [Ruby Installer](https://rubyinstaller.org/).
4. Download a copy of the [simple-pages](https://github.com/pdg137/simple-pages/) repository and rename it to your own project's name.
5. In the project folder, run `update.bat`.  This will take a few minutes to download and build various Ruby packages from the Internet.
6. Run `server.bat`.

A browser tab should open with a preview of your new site! Next you can
customize your site with `_config.yml` and `index.md` and start writing posts.
