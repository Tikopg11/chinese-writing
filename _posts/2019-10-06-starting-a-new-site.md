1. Follow instructions on GitHub to create a new repository. Do not initialize
   it with any files such as a README.
2. Clone the repository.
3. From your repository, pull in this template:
    ```
    git remote add simple-pages git@github.com:pdg137/simple-pages.git
    git pull simple-pages master
    ```
4. Verify that you can run the server locally, then do `git push` to update
   your pages on GitHub.
5. In your project settings on GitHub, find the section for Pages, and set
   it to "master branch".
6. Find that section again and follow the link to your new site.
